The Gendersllnl package is a local genders package that contains
libraries with extra helper functions for Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory (LLNL) specific needs.  They illustrate how local APIs can
be developed on top of the genders base API.  The LLNL tool dist2 is
also included in the Gendersllnl package.

A number of the libraries and tools in this package may be useful for
clusters outside of Lawrence Livermore, but they may need to be
modified for use on your particular systems.  They are perhaps best
used as an illustration of how libraries and tools can be built
on top of the base genders libraries and tools.

This package includes:

* libgendersllnl    
  - A C library with additional genders functions for unique LLNL needs.
    See libgendersllnl(3).

* Libgendersllnl.pm
  - A Perl module developed with Perl Extensions that takes advantage
    of the already available C library.  Perl extensions is limited
    and provides an unorthodox Perl API.  It is therefore recommended
    that users use Gendersllnl.pm.  See Libgendersllnl(3).

* Gendersllnl.pm
  - A Perl module that interfaces with Libgendersllnl.pm, hiding away
    the ugliness of Libgendersllnl.pm.  See Gendersllnl(3).

* dist2
  - Dist2 is an rdist preprocessor that expands specially formatted
    macros with embedded genders attributes into node lists. When the
    genders database changes, dist2 can be rerun to redistribute
    appropriate configuration file variations.  Dist2 assumes a
    particular file system setup for rdisted files.  The tool should
    be looked at as an illustration of how Genders can be used for
    powerful cluster management.  It will most likely not work by default
    for a non-LLNL environment.  See dist2(1).

* dist_all, dist_local, dist_cmp, dist_bootstrap
  - Wrappers around dist2, see individual manpages for details.

* inst
  - Similar to gnu fileutils install -C, tuned for dist2 needs.
