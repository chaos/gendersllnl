Gendersllnl is a package of libraries and tools written around genders
for use at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories.  A number of
these libraries and tools may or may not be useful.  Some of them may
need to be modified for use on your particular systems.  (This is why
it is called the GendersLLNL, duh! :-).

This package includes:

* libgendersllnl    
  - A C library which can be linked with -lgendersllnl.  Includes a
    number of library functions particularly useful for LLNL code.
    See libgendersllnl(3).

* Libgendersllnl.pm
  - A Perl module developed with Perl Extensions that accesses
    the C library.  Perl extensions is limited and provides
    a very strange Perl API.  It is therefore recommended most users
    use Gendersllnl.pm.  See Libgendersllnl(3).

* Gendersllnl.pm
  - A Perl module that interfaces with Libgendersllnl.pm, hiding away
    the yuckiness of Libgendersllnl.pm.  See Gendersllnl(3).

* dist2
  - Wrapper for USC rdist which expands special macros into node lists
    from /etc/genders and operators on a localization "repository" in
    /var/dist.  See dist2(1).

* dist_all, dist_local, dist_cmp, dist_bootstrap
  - Wrappers arond dist2, see manpages for details.

* inst
  - Similar to gnu fileutils install -C, tuned for dist2 needs.

Comments, patches, fixes, suggestions are always welcome.
