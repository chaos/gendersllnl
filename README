Originally, many of the functions and tools in this package were
included in the Genders package.  It was later decided to split the
Genders into two different packages:

1) Genders - a package of generic cluster database libraries and
tools.

2) Gendersllnl - a package of libraries and tools built around
Genders, for use on Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)
clusters.

This split allows Genders to be potentially more useful to
administrators and developers outside of LLNL, but allows us to
keep our specific Genders needs at the laboratory.

A number of the libraries and tools in this package may be useful for
clusters outside of Lawrence Livermore, but they may need to be
modified for use on your particular systems.  Some may be of
absolutely no use.

This package includes:

* libgendersllnl    
  - A C library which can be linked with -lgendersllnl.  Includes a
    number of library functions particularly useful for LLNL code.
    See libgendersllnl(3).

* Libgendersllnl.pm
  - A Perl module developed with Perl Extensions that accesses
    the C library.  Perl extensions is limited and provides
    a very strange Perl API.  It is therefore recommended most users
    use Gendersllnl.pm.  See Libgendersllnl(3).

* Gendersllnl.pm
  - A Perl module that interfaces with Libgendersllnl.pm, hiding away
    the yuckiness of Libgendersllnl.pm.  See Gendersllnl(3).

* dist2
  - Wrapper for USC rdist which expands special macros into node lists
    from /etc/genders and operators on a localization "repository" in
    /var/dist.  See dist2(1).

* dist_all, dist_local, dist_cmp, dist_bootstrap
  - Wrappers around dist2, see manpages for details.

* inst
  - Similar to gnu fileutils install -C, tuned for dist2 needs.
