.TH DIST_LOCAL 1 "4/14/99" "LLNL" "DIST_LOCAL"
.SH NAME
dist_local \- local rdist script
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dist_local
.I "[package[.fileset]] ..."
.SH DESCRIPTION
The purpose of 
.B dist_local
is to update files on the local node from the /var/dist rdist repository.
It simply executes
.B "dist2 -l"
on the local node.
.B "dist2"
in turn runs rdist against files located in the NFS-mounted rdist repository,
/var/dist.
.LP
All arguments are passed on to
.B "dist2."
Typically these include the names of packages/filesets to be updated.
Packages are groups of files managed by a single Distfile in /var/dist, and 
filesets are labels within Distfiles.  If no packages are specified, everything
in /var/dist updated.
.LP
When
.B dist_local
is executed,
.B rdist
will typically start the 
.B rdist
server through a network connection, even though the server will run
on the local machine.  In order to avoid this network connection, the
.I -L
option can be specified.  When the 
.I -L
option is specified, each occurrence of the local hostname in the
Distfiles is replaced with the string "localhost".  This forces
.B rdist
to run the 
.B rdist
server locally in a shell. The 
.I -H
option can be used to specify an alternate hostname to replace with
the "localhost" string.
The
.I -H
option can only be used when the 
.I -L 
option is specified.
.LP
