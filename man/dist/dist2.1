.TH DIST2 1 "2/10/04" "LLNL" "DIST2"
.SH NAME
dist2 \- rdist wrapper
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dist2
.I "[-o rdist_opts] [-V] [-c cluster] [-P transport_program] [-F genders-file] [-d] [-n] [-i] [-v] [node spec] [package.[fileset]...]"
.br
.B dist2
.I "[-o rdist_opts] [-V] [-c cluster] [-P transport_program] [-F genders-file] [-d] [-n] [-i] [-v] [node spec] -f Distfile"
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Dist2
is a wrapper for USC 
.B rdist
which adds a powerful macro capability based on the
.I "genders file,"
and abstracts a collection of Distfiles into an
.I "rdist repository"
made up of 
.I "packages"
and
.I "filesets."
It operates as follows:
.IP
1) Chdir to /var/dist (the rdist repository) and verify that the dummy file
VAR_DIST_IS_MOUNTED exists.
.IP
2) Determine the appropriate set of Distfiles corresponding to
.I packages
specified on the command line.  If packages are specified, select
Distfile.{package list}, otherwise Distfile.{all packages}.
.IP
3) Scan the Distfiles for macro references of the form ${attr_attrname} 
or ${attr_attrname=value} and
prepend macro definitions based on the content of the genders file.
In the example above, all nodes carrying the genders attribute 
.I attrname
or attribute and value
.I attrname=value 
would be listed in the definition.
.IP
4) Send the resulting concatenation of Distfiles and macro definitions to
the
.B rdist
program.
.LP
Node specification options are
.I -w node1,node2,node3,
.I -w node[X-Y],
.I -g genders_query
or
.I -l.
In the absence of these options,
all nodes targeted by the preprocessed Distfile (potentially all nodes 
appearing in the genders file) are updated.  
.LP
Please see
.B nodeattr(1)
for more information on the format of a genders_query.
.LP
.I -w
limits the update to the listed nodes.  Nodes can be specified in a
comma separated list or in hostlist format.  See HOST RANGES below for
information on the hostlist format.  Always specify the name as it
appears in the genders file; generally the primary hostname as
reported by the
.B hostname
command.
.LP
.I -g
similarly selects the set of nodes that have the specified genders attribute.
.LP
.I -l
selects the local hostname (through genders).  
.LP
When the
.I -l
option is not used, the -x and -v options can be used to exclude a set of
nodes.  
The
.I -x
option can be used similarly to the
.I -w 
option to explicitly list a set of nodes to exclude.  The nodes should
be specified as it appears in the genders file.  The
.I -v
option exclude nodes that
.B whatsup(1)
determines are down.  When both of the options are used, 
.B dist2
will first eliminate those nodes specified with the 
.I -x
option.  If 
.B whatsup(1)
is not installed, the 
.I -v 
option will fail.
.LP
When the -l option is specified, 
.B rdist
will typically start the
.B rdist
server through a network connection, even though the server will run
on the local machine.  In order to avoid this network connection, the
.I -L
option can be specified.  When the 
.I -L
option is specified, each occurrence of the local hostname in the
Distfiles is replaced with the string "localhost".  This forces
.B rdist
to run the 
.B rdist
server locally in a shell. The 
.I -H
option can be used to specify an alternate hostname to replace with
the "localhost" string.
The 
.I -L
option can only be used when the 
.I -l 
option is specified.  Similarly, the
.I -H
option can only be used when the 
.I -l 
and 
.I -L 
options are specified.
.LP
.I -i
selects canonical hostnames (the left hand side of a genders file entry).
The default on the SP is to convert these "initial_hostname" values to 
"reliable_hostname" via the SDR.  Elsewhere, the conversion is based on
taking the value of an "altname" genders attribute, if any.  This option
defeats this conversion.
.LP
The
.I -o
option can be used to pass options to
.B rdist.
The 
.I -o 
option's arguments are identical to those specified in the
.B rdist(1)
manpage.
The 
.I -V
option can be used as shorthand to pass the "verify" option to rdist.
.LP
The 
.I -P 
option can be used to pass an alternate transport program to rdist, so
that rdist may use it rather than the default of
.B rsh(1).  
The 
.I -P 
option's argument should be specified just as it is specified in the
.B rdist
manpage.  An alternate transport program can also be specified via the
genders attribute 'rsh_alt_path'.
.LP
.I -d
is used for debugging Distfile problems.  When
.B rdist
reports a syntax error, it refers to line numbers in the preprocessed
Distfile.  This option provides a means for the Distfile author to see
the preprocessed version.  If 
.I -n 
is also specified, line numbers will be prepended to each line.
.LP
The 
.I -c
option can be used to specify an alternate cluster to the one
.B dist2
is run on.
.LP
The
.I -F
option can be used to specify a specific genders file to use rather
than the default found for a cluster.
.LP
/var/dist is actually used to manage rdisted files across several MPP
systems.  Distfile macros of the form ${attr_attrname} or
${attr_attrname=value} implicitly refer to the local cluster.
Specific clusters can be targeted by specifying a macro of the form
${clustername!attr_attrname} or ${clustername!attr_attrname=value}.
These definitions expand to empty lists on clusters other than the one
specified.
.LP
Put another way, ${attr_attrname} refers to all nodes in all clusters with the 
.I attrname
attribute, ${attr_attrname=value} refers to all nodes in all clusters with
the 
.I attrname
attribute equal to
.I value.
${clustername!attr_attrname} only refers to the nodes in 
.I clustername
with the 
.I attrname
attribute, and ${clustername!attr_attrname=value} only refers to the nodes in
.I clustername
with the 
.I attrname
attribute equal to
.I value.
.LP
You can also substitute genders values using 
.I ${attrval_[value]}.  
For instance
.I ${attrval_cluster} 
would substitute the name of the cluster that dist2 was running on.
This can be very useful.  Take for example the following case...

genders/genders.${attrval_cluster} -> ${${attrval_cluster}!attr_all}
     install /etc/genders

The above example could be used to install a cluster specific genders
file on any number of clusters.  This also make adding new clusters to
your rdist scheme trivial as all you need to do is create a 
genders.[clustername] file.

Note that trying to reference a genders attribute that either doesn't
have an associated value or does not exist will cause processing of 
that file to abort.  The dist2 script will however continue processing
with the next file.

.SH "HOST RANGES"
.B dist2
accepts ranges of hostnames in the general form: prefix[n-m,l-k,...],
where n < m and l < k, etc., as an alternative to explicit lists of
hosts.  This form should not be confused with regular expression
character classes (also denoted by ``[]''). For example, foo[19] does
not represent foo1 or foo9, but rather represents a degenerate range:
foo19.

This range syntax is meant only as a convenience on clusters with a
prefixNN naming convention and specification of ranges should not be
considered necessary -- the list foo1,foo9 could be specified as such,
or by the range foo[1,9].

Some examples of range usage follow:
    foo[01-05] instead of foo01,foo02,foo03,foo04,foo05
    foo[7,9-10] instead of foo7,foo9,foo10
    foo[0-3] instead of foo0,foo1,foo2,foo3

As a reminder to the reader, some shells will interpret brackets ('['
and ']') for pattern matching.  Depending on your shell, it may be
necessary to enclose ranged lists within quotes.
.SH "BUGS"
When expanding macros, we actually refer to /var/dist/genders/genders.clustername
instead of the installed version, /etc/genders.  Since the genders file
is under rdist control, referring directly to the source file eliminates a
potential bootstrapping problem.  On the other hand, it's ugly to hardcode
the source path, and we refer to other files in their installed location.
