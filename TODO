Jim Garlick:

- Consider migrating some dist2 code into rdist, linked with genders API e.g.
  o natively expand ${cluster!attr_host} macros (modify yacc grammar)
  o select from multiple (configurable) remote shell services
- If rdist is modified, also consider adding:
  o accept target selection parameters that include host ranges or genders
    attributes and convert between primary and alternate hostnames
  o add options for setting permissions/ownership in Distfiles, eliminating
    the need for the root install from package source into /var/dist.
